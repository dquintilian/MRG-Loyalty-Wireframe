# MRG-Loyalty-Wireframe

## Goal: Help MRG Group the Entertainment Corporation gain a competitive advantage in the post COVID events market

During my undergraduate Capstone program I connected with a contact at MRG group to complete my thesis project in collaboration with their company.

After gathering requirements from many different stakeholders through the corporation one clear problem became apparent.

It was going to be difficult for the company to retain the customers they had prior to the pandemic. 

I recognized that the company had one key competitive advantage they had not yet taken advantage of, their ecosystem. MRG group had properties in many different spaces. They had events venues they owned, concert promotion business, restaurants and even bars. After interviewing many of MRG's customers, and recognizing how poor MRG groups relationship was with customers, there was an opportunity to design a loyalty application for the company to use to reward customers who frequented each of their different businesses.

After multiple iterations of the product, I came up with the following wireframe.
